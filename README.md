# NIST-CSF-2.0-Workbook
A maturity workbook for NIST CSF 2.0 

I've put together this workbook to help anyone—whether you're a small business, a consultant, or just curious—assess your cybersecurity maturity using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework 2.0. It's super easy to use and totally customizable, so you can make it work for you.

Here's what you can do with it:

Quick Assessment: Check out the different functions and controls. Just rate yourself in each control to see where you stand.

Make It Your Own: Feel free to tweak the workbook to fit your unique situation. It's all about making cybersecurity work for you, not the other way around.

Get Your Score: Once you've rated yourself in each area, you'll get a score that shows how mature your cybersecurity program is. It's a great way to see what's going well and what might need a little extra attention.
